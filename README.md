# Hello World

Hello, this is my first repository. I'm going to use this repository only for tutorial and such so there is nothing to see here. This tutorial contains various things related to github from git, repositories, markdown, etc. Tutorial starts with this README note that is going to explain about Markdown syntax. 

> The tutorial starts....... Now

# Markdown Basic Syntax

## Headings

To create heading, add number signs or i call it a hashtag (#) in front of a word or phrase. There are six level of Headings and it is determined by the number of hashtags. One '#' means heading level one and six '#' means heading level two. Here are the examples:

 - '\# Heading Level One'
 - '\### Heading Level Three'
 - '\###### Heading Level Six'
 
 There are a number or alternate syntax, but this one is the most recommended to use
 
 ## Paragraphs
 
 To create Paragraphs use a **blank line** to separate one or more lines of text. In other words, type 'spacebar' twice or if your Markdown application supports HTML you can type **'<br>' twice** to make a paragraph . If you press it only one time then it will be considered the same paragraph. For example:
 
| Markdown                 |           Output    |
| ----------------------   | ------------------  |
| This is the correct way to make paragraph. This is paragraph one<br><br>And this is paragraph two, See that there is a blank line here | This is the correct way to make paragraph. This is paragraph one<br><br>And this is paragraph two, See that there is a blank line here|
| Now, here is the wrong way to make paragraph. This is paragraph one<br>This is paragraph two. There are no blank line here so it will be considered the same paragraph | Now, here is the wrong way to make paragraph. This is paragraph one This is paragraph two. There are no blank line here so it will be considered the same paragraph |

## Line Breaks

To create line breaks or a new line, end a line with **two or more spaces, then type 'return' or 'enter'**. Or if your Markdown application support HTML you can type '<br>'. Here are the examples:

| Markdown                          |            Output               |
| -------------------------------   | -----------------------------   |
| There are two spaces after this line. You just cant see it.<br> this is the next line | There are two spaces after this line. You just cant see it.<br>this is the next line |
| And now an example using '\<br\>' after a line\<br\> and here is the new line | And now an example using '\<br\>' after a line<br> and here is the new line

## Emphasis

You can add emphasis by making text bold, italic, or both. To add emphasis, use asterisks (**\***) or underscores (**\_**) before and after a word or phrase. It is more recommended to use afterisk instead of underscores because underscores have some constraints like can't be used between words. The type of emphasis depends on the number of asterisks and underscores used.

### Bold

To bold text, use **two** asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. Here are the examples:

| Markdown                                    |    Output                                  |
| -------------------------------------       |  ----------------------------------------- |
| This is \*\*bold text\*\*                   |      This is **bold text**                 |
| This is also \_\_bold text\_\_              |      This is also __bold text__            |
| Use asterisk to Bold\*\*Between\*\*Text     |  Use asterisk to Bold**Between**Text       |
| Underscore cant be Used\_\_Between\_\_Text  | Underscore cant be Used__Between__Text     |

### Italic

To italicize text, use **one** asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. Here are the examples:

| Markdown                                  |    Output                                  |
| -------------------------------------     |  ----------------------------------------- |
| This is \*italic text\*                   |      This is *italic text*                 |
| This is also \_italic text\_              |      This is also _italic text_            |
| Use asterisk to Italicize\*Between\*Text  |  Use asterisk to Italicize*Between*Text    |
| Underscore cant be Used\_Between\_Text    | Underscore cant be Used_Between_Text       |

### Bold and italic

To add both bold and italic emphasis, use three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. Here are the examples:

| Markdown                                        | Output                                        |
|-----------------------------------------        | ----------------------------------------      |
| This is \*\*\*bold and italic text\*\*\*        | This is ***bold and italic text***            |
| This is also \_\_\_bold and italic text\_\_\_   | This is also ___bold and italic text___       |
| Use asterisk to Emphasis\*\*\*Between\*\*\*Words| Use asterisk to Emphasis***Between***Words    |
| Underscore cant be Used\_\_\_Between\_\_\_Words | Underscore cant be Used___Between___Words     |


## Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add a '>' in front of a paragraph. Blockquotes is used to make a certain word or phrase more noticeable. Usually used by writers to "quote" certain sentences. Here are the examples

##### Markdown
\> This is a blockquote example

##### Output
> This is a blockquote example

### Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. To create this is quite straightforward that is to use a blank line after a '>'. Here are the example

##### Markdown
\> This is the first paragraph
\>
\> This is the second paragraph

##### Output
> This is the first paragraph
>
> This is the second paragraph

### Nested Blockqoutes

Blockquotes can be nested
